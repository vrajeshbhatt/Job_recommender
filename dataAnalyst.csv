More about Hopper

Despite the pandemic’s impact on the travel industry, Hopper has emerged stronger than ever. As the travel industry continues to rebound, Hopper has demonstrated significant outperformance with its category-leading mobile-only marketplace, delivering value to customers and supply partners with the company’s proprietary suite of fintech offerings .

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper’s valuation is now over $5B, which is more than triple our valuation from early 2020.

The company grew its revenue by more than 300% YoY in 2021. Hopper’s monthly revenues are now 375% higher than its pre-pandemic high point and Hopper Cloud, Hopper’s new B2B initiative, is already 15% of its revenues and growing.

According to Apptopia, Hopper was the #1 most downloaded OTA in the US in 2021. The app has over 70 million downloads.

Hopper’s recovery is faster than the market and its share of the air travel market in North America is now 300% higher than prior to the pandemic, according to MIDT. We are now the 3rd largest air travel agency in North America.

The company sells over $2B in travel and travel related financial services annually.

Hopper’s fintech offerings, such as Price Freeze and Rebooking Guarantee, now represent over 70% of its air revenue.

Given the success of its travel fintech, Hopper recently launched a B2B initiative called Hopper Cloud, where any travel provider can unlock a totally unique revenue stream by seamlessly integrating and offering Hopper’s travel content and fintech products. Hopper Cloud partners include Capital One, Kayak, Marriott, Amadeus, Trip.com , and MakeMyTrip.

The industry opportunity for Hopper Cloud is enormous as projections estimate that if all travel distribution channels offered travel fintech, it could increase the total consumer spend for the sector by $200 billion annually.

And all this recent growth is just the beginning. There are still so many new opportunities we’re excited to tackle in the next year!"

238,Senior Market Operations Analyst,Peak Power,404,"Toronto, ON","Posted
Posted 17 days ago","Let’s make Power Plants Obsolete.
The current, centralized electricity system is not sustainable. Between the climate crisis, state-wide blackouts, aging infrastructure, and rising costs, the system needs a huge overhaul. The demand for electricity is high – and getting higher – and big power plants aren't meeting our needs. We say it's time to disrupt and decentralize.
At Peak Power, we're energy nerds that develop software for the real estate sector. Our tech turns commercial buildings and industrial facilities into hubs in a new, decentralized electricity system. This means cleaner, more reliable, and more affordable electricity. We’re powering the clean energy revolution.
Peak Power has developed a comprehensive software platform that alleviates strain on the electricity grid and drives value to owners of clean energy assets, buildings, and electric vehicles (EVs) through electricity markets.

The Opportunity
Reporting to the Manager - Asset Management and Market Operations, the Market Operations Analyst will be pivotal in driving the execution and delivery of day-to-day operations of Peak's electric asset portfolio. You will interface with multiple Peak Power assets across ISO regions and leverage analytics to optimize and build scalable operations practices to support our growing energy storage business. You will leverage your understanding of Independent Systems Operator (ISO) electricity markets, energy storage, and power systems to develop and position Peak's electric asset portfolio. So, if you are passionate about data analytics, and would like to apply your talents toward reducing the carbon intensity of the grid, then we'd like to hear from you!
This work matters. Even a small change to optimize power utilization can significantly impact our customers, electrical grid, and environment. We're building something that will have a lasting, positive impact.

Our new Senior Market Operations Analyst will:
Deliver. You have excellent time management, prioritization, and project management skills to ensure operational performance targets and project milestones are met or exceeded.
Dispatch energy storage resources for wholesale revenues and behind-the-meter applications while following bid optimization strategy and complying with market rules
Supporting all aspects of registration, metering, data management, and maintenance of Peak’s clients and its assets in different energy markets and Demand Response programs
Report. You will monitor and report on progress, methodically evaluate processes and systems to improve efficiency; and implement processes that provide transparency and tracking
Track asset and corporate performance requirements in each ISO/Utility Program and prepare asset performance and energy market reports for internal and external stakeholders.
Create quantitative analysis and run advanced pricing and economic models (Excel/Python) to assess energy storage projects under a variety of use cases
Collaborate. You have strong interpersonal and communication skills to enable effective operations that require input, buy-in, and execution across multiple departments, as well as customer and stakeholder communications.
Work with the Product and Software Development team to test, monitor, iterate, and automate asset operations tasks
Support business development efforts through customer information analysis to assess suitability of clients for available monetization and savings opportunities
Grow. You are a critical thinker who can seize opportunities to create value for Peak Power’s long-term vision for optimizing power utilization and energy storage. You will proactively identify opportunities to improve operational performance, efficiency, and scalability and contribute to Peak Power’s electric asset portfolio growth.

What you bring to Peak Power:
The education. You have an undergraduate degree in Science, Engineering, Business, Economics, or a related field. A higher education degree or additional training in project management, data analysis, or operations is considered an asset.
The experience. You have proven experience delivering success in a fast-paced, multi-tasking, team coordination role. You have a minimum of 2-3 years of professional experience with statistical techniques and concepts, data analysis using excel and python, or can demonstrate alternative knowledge that has prepared you for this role. Specific experience in the energy markets or electricity sectors/Demand Response is considered an asset.
The drive and curiosity. You have a roll up your sleeves attitude and are motivated to solve problems and support team success. You are passionate about contributing to innovative solutions to climate change.
The flexibility. You are flexible to adapt your activities as needed to support evolving team priorities in a rapidly changing business environment. You are comfortable with ambiguity and are willing to figure things out when there is no clear, defined path or process outlined. You have proactiveness in identifying problems & finding solutions.
So why Peak Power?
