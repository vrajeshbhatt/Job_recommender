Technical degree required; Computer Science or Math background desired
2+ years relevant experience in technology/software sales or pre-sales consulting
Job summary
Do you like startups? Are you interested in cloud computing? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and to challenge the status quo. To address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you’ll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll get the chance to share your knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

Working knowledge of software development tools and methodologies
Experience in the startup community as either a founder, mentor, investor, or early technical employee
Experience architecting/operating solutions build on AWS
Presentation skills with a high degree of comfort speaking with executives, IT Management, and developers
Excellent communication skills with an ability to right level conversations
Demonstrated ability to adapt to new technologies and learn quickly

Posted 30+ days ago","Introduction

Do you want to use your new technical and programming skills to build fast-paced, 6 week projects for the world’s biggest companies? Do you want to build some of the most innovative and impactful solutions in cloud, trustworthy AI, security, and beyond? If so, join us in IBM Client Engineering!
IBM Client Engineering is a technical pre-sales agile team, helping our customers transform their business. We work directly with our customers in small teams of cloud developers, data scientists, solution architects, designers, and other experts to co-develop real business solutions. Not only will you get experience across the top brands and industries, but you will also have access to the entire IBM research, services, and product teams to help our customers succeed.
This role is hands on. You will grow your technical skills in the most current IBM Cloud and AI solutions, while leveraging open source for leading industries. You will join teams working directly with customers, defining solutions, and leading the way in how they get built in the age of cloud and AI.

Your Role and Responsibilities

Your primary focus will be facilitating interactive workshops with clients. We have a set of standard approaches, but every engagement is customized – sometimes in “real time”. When your team is asked to work on a client project, you will participate in determining the right fit between the client and the Client Engineering Team, and best approach for the workshop.
When it comes to workshops, a Client Engineering Designer incorporates three roles: Facilitator, Consultant, and Designer.
As a Facilitator, you will set up the logistics and customize the materials. You will be responsible for running the meetings, ensuring the team stays on track, and keeping a high-level view toward a successful outcome.
Simultaneously, you’re a Consultant, building a relationship with interdisciplinary IBM and client teams to deliver value to the client and create opportunities for IBM.
As a Designer, you’re advocating for the end user’s needs and positive user experiences.
Following a workshop, you may create designs for a Proof of Concept, a demo, or a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Currently we use Sketch for wireframes and InVision for clickable prototypes. You may also be engaged in information architecture, research, or evaluation.
The engagement is successful when it has guided clients through our process to where they are aligned on outcomes, convinced of the efficacy of IBM’s technology, and committed to working with IBM’s people, products, and services.
For this Client Engineering Designer position, the design work is concepts and processes – uncovering business value, defining a problem, shaping solutions, and proving them out. What you’re creating will look less like a visual designer’s portfolio and more like a user researcher’s portfolio.
During the dedicated development program, we provide extraordinary training in technology and industry solutions, highlighted with shadowing opportunities, and consultative sales experience through a combination of classroom, online resources, hands-on field experiences, and structured mentorship We will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to make an immediate impact and achieve individual growth as a leader.
