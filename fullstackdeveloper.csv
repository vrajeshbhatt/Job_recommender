About the Engineering Team:

We aim to meaningfully improve the lives of small business owners, who are traditionally under-served and often struggle because of this.

This means being involved in the research, design, and organizational and maintenance practices behind our wide range of applications, which are relied upon by tens of thousands of small business owners. You won’t find many hardcore specialists here. Most Wave engineers are willing and able to dive into different technologies to get the job done. This requires curiosity, openness to new ideas and perspectives, and a genuine interest in what makes software products tick.

About The Role:

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will join one of the many cross-functional engineering team to work alongside Product, Design and other developers to bring your engineering skill to bear on exciting business challenges. You will work with some fantastic engineers to solve tough problems in delivering world-class financial products to our customers at scale. You will work with a wide variety of technologies and help investigate new ones as we are constantly striving for to keep our technology choices up to date.

Tina Goyal: Senior Engineering Director at Wave. Tina is passionate about building software teams and products, leadership, coaching and creating a culture of trust, excellence and collaboration.
Here’s What You Should Know About Engineering at Wave:
Our Technology: Wave is powered by several key technologies. Our toolkit is primarily Python and Django on the service layer, with some Ruby and Golang as well. GraphQL and REST power our APIs, and our web/mobile front-ends are React and ReactNative with Typescript. We expect software developers to have proficiency in one or more of these areas. You will be expected to be able to cross technical domains and contribute to both the back-end and front-end as needs arise.
Your Work Will Matter: Every engineer at Wave is tasked with solving meaty, meaningful challenges for a really important end-user - our small business owners. The code you write will make a difference, guaranteed.
We Are a Community: Wave is about the size of a small neighbourhood. It is possible to get to know everyone on a personal basis. If you’re trying to solve a hard problem that has roots in some other part of the company, odds are pretty good that you’ll find someone close by who can help you out.
You Will be Stretched: We’re big on transparency and we know Wave isn’t for everyone. However, if you’re ready to flex your creativity, excel at your craft, fuel your curiosity, and thrive in a dynamic environment, we’re confident you’ll love being a Waver.

Skilled, knowledgeable people are critical to the success of the CSI group of companies. There are career opportunities both within and across our group of companies. In support of your continuing career development and growth, we would like to bring to your attention the employment opportunities available within your own company and those currently available across all of the CSI group of companies.
Should you be interested in investigating these opportunities, please follow the instructions outlined in each job ad OR if you know of a potential candidate, please promote the opportunity.
Intra-Company Application Process:
Ideally all employees should feel confident in their ability to have an open and candid discussion with their immediate manager about career interests and career plans.
However, in recognition that not all employees may have this rapport with their manager, our intra-company application process will, as a first step, ensure that employees have the opportunity to investigate career opportunities with assurance that their initial interest will be held in strict confidence. Consequently, the following application process has been established:
If you are interested in an opportunity at one of the CSI group of companies, please contact the individual listed in the company job ad. They can provide you with details about the opportunity and will do a preliminary assessment as to your suitability for the position. Should both you and the company wish to proceed further, you will go through the initial interview process. After this initial interview if there is interest by both you and the company to move forward, you will be required to communicate your interest in this opportunity with your current manager. Human Resources will also be made aware of your interest and will make available to the hiring company performance related and other reference material.
Again, if required, confidentiality at the onset will allow you to investigate options across the CSI group of companies. However, once mutual interest is established, you will need to speak to your manager before the interview process continues. We believe that it is important that you initiate an open discussion with your current manager about your career interests and permit him/her to understand and respond to this interest.

Description

Who we are


We believe that Developer Experience (DX) is one of the strongest predictors of organizational performance. Our goal is to help developers ship sooner, safer and happier by bringing focus, flow and joy to their working lives. It's our privilege to partner with developers across the entire software development lifecycle to help transform what they think, feel and value about their work. We move big rocks, pave commonly travelled roads, build helpful products/tools and gather insightful metrics. Most importantly, we listen closely to and advocate for our internal developer community.

As the DX team, we work at the intersection of Platform Engineering, Experience Design, and Developer Relations. We create practical developer tools and best practices, easy-to-use development environments, healthy codebases, empowered automated testing and frictionless releases.

We work primarily in the Node/Javascript ecosystem, servicing hundreds of microservices, SPAs and micro-frontends. Our work is informed by the hundreds of developers who use our products and is guided by leading research in DevOps, SRE, Developer Productivity and Developer Satisfaction.

We strive to lead by example and are committed to work-life balance, individual well-being, flexible working hours, reasonable paid-on-call duties, on-the-job learning, customer-led product development and pragmatic programming.

What you’ll do


As a Developer Experience Engineer, you'll create and communicate everything we need to enable great developer experiences. We operate as a Platform Team:

50% Platform Engineering
25% Developer Relations
25% Embedded DX Enablement

We measure DX across multiple dimensions and prioritize the most impactful initiatives. Our team is also conscious of how these initiatives impact longer-term strategic performance through metrics like DORA (Lead Time for Changes, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate and Time to Restore Service) and the SPACE Framework

You'll spend much of your time contributing to longer-term objectives as part of a team of Platform Developers. Our strategic initiatives are:

Establishing core Developer Experience, Software Delivery and Operational metrics
Enhancing our Continuous Delivery capabilities (Highly-optimized CI/CD Pipelines, tooling and best practices for Feature Toggles, Full-stack Review Environments, Automated Canary Releases)
Developing tooling for large-scale automated code rollouts and migrations

You'll also spend part of your time embedded in stream-aligned teams, where you'll seek to understand and document barriers to DX and then work with teams to improve them.
While embedded on teams, you will:

Work closely with the team to understand their challenges and points of friction
Document findings using Developer Journey Maps and Developer Friction Audits
Help solve challenges as an individual contributor (code, documentation, process, etc.)
Advocate for addressing significant hurdles and shared challenges in the Platform Engineering backlog and initiating cross-team working groups

You'll also play an active role in Developer Relations. You'll engage our community on Slack and in-person by:

Raising awareness of our projects and initiatives
Sharing technical inspirations and knowledge
Helping developers find the resources they need
Participating in technical discussions and working groups
Collecting and soliciting feedback from developers
Evaluating developer sentiment on key initiatives

We are committed to balancing flow with community engagement, so you'll influence what that looks like for yourself.

Qualifications

Who we are looking for

Someone who is excited about improving the working lives of developers and understands the conditions in which they thrive
A community builder who listens to and empowers others
A strong technical generalist capable of working across the stack end-to-end to enable developers
Expert understanding of contemporary development practices and tooling
Collaborative technical leader with full-stack experience who enjoys regularly getting their work into the hands of developers
A compelling written and verbal communicator
Ability to lead technical discussions through great technical story-telling
Solid understanding of the nature of software development and ability to advocate for practices which improve developer well-being and effectiveness
Enthusiasm for learning and sharing new technologies
Ability to work collaboratively within teams, working groups and across large organizations
Experience mentoring and growing other developers
A pragmatic mindset and ability to design solutions within constraints
Someone who can design, build and ship independently when needed
Ability to work in a remote-first environment — we’re aiming for async, but we’ll need your help to get there

Nice to haves

Experience with the Javascript/TypeScript ecosystem
Experience with Frontend Development practices and tooling (React/Redux, Webpack, NEXTJs, etc.)
Experience with API architectures and tooling (Express, Fastify, NestJs, etc.)
Experience with CI/CD tooling (Jenkins, Github Actions, Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, ArgoCD etc.)
Experience with Linux/Command-line
Experience with Observability/Telemetry tooling and practices (New Relic, Dynatrace, OpenTelemetry)
Experience with Containers (Docker) and Kubernetes (Google Cloud Platform GKE, Openshift 4 Dedicated)
Experience with Vault, Terraform and Consul
Experience with Developer Relations or Developer Advocacy
Experience with Security tooling (SCA, SAST, DAST, IAST, RASP)
What your first year will look like

Week one - Monday, meet the team and your onboarding partner. Spend the rest of the week learning about our tools, capabilities and practices while keeping an onboarding friction journal. Every Friday is dedicated to self-directed professional development, so use your time to explore something that's piqued your interest.
Month one - You'll spend your first month getting up to speed with the help of your onboarding partner. You'll also go over your onboarding friction journal with the team, who can help identify what point of friction you can help alleviate as part of your first contribution.
Month three - You'll be working from the team's backlog by your third month. You'll also spend this time getting to know our developer community by setting up informal introductions and learning more about what other teams are making.
Month six - Now that you are comfortable working from the backlog, it's time to learn how we collaborate across teams. This month you'll join your first working group along with another member of our team, where you'll learn about a shared challenge and how you might contribute. You'll also be playing a more prominent role in engaging our developer community on Slack.
Month nine and beyond - By now, you should have a solid understanding of what it's like to work at TELUS Digital and some of the most impactful challenges to tackle. This month you'll start your first DX enablement rotation by embedding with another team. As this is your first rotation, you'll also pair with someone on our team to help set you up in the right way. Once you've completed your rotation, you'll rejoin our team and begin to tackle one of the challenges you uncovered during your embed."
