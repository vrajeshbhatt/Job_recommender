Posted 25 days ago","Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).
What you will do:
As a cloud developer intern, you will work with as part of our teams to build and deploy applications (the ‘thread or if you prefer ‘duct tape’) that enable business and operational requirements using cloud provider services (‘fabric’ or ‘lego pieces’).
We will also support your contributions to projects that demonstrate the power of the cloud – prior intern projects included web apps to provide transcription to recorded sessions and using algorithms to project spend / cost of large computing environments.
Who you are:
2+ years in a Computer Science, Computer Engineering degree program or equivalent
Solid programming experience showcased by great marks in classes (C/C+ classes preferred) and/or publicly cited / referenced code on Github
Experience with Linux distros and/or Unix flavors
Bonus Points:
Graduate experience or acceptance into Master's / PhD
Experience with AWS or other cloud providers
Strong scripting experience (Python, bash)
Relevant experience exemplified by hobbies or university design team(s)
About State Street
Across the globe, institutional investors rely on us to help them manage risk, respond to challenges, and drive performance and profitability. We keep our clients at the heart of everything we do, and smart, engaged employees are essential to our continued success.
Our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential infuses our company values. It’s also part of our commitment to inclusion, development and engagement, and corporate social responsibility. You’ll have tools to help balance your professional and personal life, paid volunteer days, and access to employee networks that help you stay connected to what matters to you. Join us.
